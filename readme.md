## About
This project contains a simulation and a visualisation of a intersection, both made in Python with Mesa. We used the simulation to see if we could improve the intersection. We did this by increasing the time a certain light would be green. To see the results you can take a look in our notebooks or read out report, which is in Dutch.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8
- Mesa installed
- Pandas installed
- Numpy installed

## Import new intersection
1. Put the XML file in tools > input
2. Run the XML tool 
3. Run the JSON tool (In the json tool there is a parameter that needs to be set. This paramter sends the data either to the simulation or the visualisation)
4. Run the simulation
